                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly transformed the world of information technology. Machines are now capable of learning, analyzing, and solving problems — once tasks that only humans could do. AI enables automation, improves efficiency, and provides accurate decision-making tools in fields like healthcare, finance, and customer service.</p>

                <p>Automation, powered by AI, helps businesses reduce repetitive work. From chatbots that handle customer inquiries to predictive analytics that forecast market trends, AI is a driving force behind smarter operations. It is not about replacing humans, but enhancing productivity and enabling people to focus on more complex and creative tasks.</p>

                <p>As AI continues to evolve, it also brings challenges, such as ethical concerns, job displacement, and data privacy. It’s essential for IT professionals to understand AI’s capabilities and limits to ensure responsible and beneficial use.</p>
