                <p>Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are reshaping the way people interact with digital environments. These technologies blend the physical and virtual worlds to create new, immersive experiences that go far beyond entertainment and gaming.</p>

                <p><strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong> completely immerses users in a digital world through headsets and sensory feedback devices. In industries like medicine, aviation, and engineering, VR simulations allow professionals to practice complex procedures and scenarios safely and cost-effectively. For example, medical students can perform virtual surgeries, and pilots can train in flight simulators that replicate real-world conditions.</p>

                <p><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong>, on the other hand, overlays digital elements onto the real world using devices such as smartphones, tablets, or AR glasses. AR enhances how people learn and work by providing real-time data and visual guides. For instance, technicians can see step-by-step repair instructions overlaid on machinery, or educators can bring textbook content to life with 3D models.</p>

                <p>Beyond education and training, VR and AR are revolutionizing marketing, real estate, retail, and tourism. Businesses use AR apps to let customers preview furniture in their homes or explore virtual tours of destinations before traveling. This interactivity improves decision-making and customer engagement.</p>

                <p>As these technologies evolve, we can expect more affordable devices, faster processing power, and broader adoption in daily life. VR and AR are no longer just futuristic concepts — they are practical tools shaping how humans experience, learn, and interact in an increasingly digital world.</p>
